# Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset

This competition give me a training set and a test set of software defects dataset. The goal of the competition is predict defects in C programs given various attributes about the code.
So I used Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Gradient Boosting to reach the goal.
