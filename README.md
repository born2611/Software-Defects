# Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset

This competition gives me a training set and a test set of software defect datasets. The goal of the competition is to predict defects in C programs given various attributes of the code. So I used Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, and Gradient Boosting to reach the goal.
